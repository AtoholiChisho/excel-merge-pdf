The provided code is a Python script for merging PDF files. It utilizes the pathlib, xlwings, and PyPDF2 libraries.

The pathlib library is a part of Python's standard library and provides an object-oriented interface to the file system. 
It is used in this code to access the source directory and create the output path.

The xlwings library is used to create an Excel add-in to run this script.
The Book.caller() method is used to obtain the reference to the current workbook, and the Book.set_mock_caller() method is used to set the 
caller to the pdfmerger.xlsm file.

The PyPDF2 library is used to merge the PDF files. The PdfFileMerger() method is used to create an instance of the PdfFileMerger class, 
and the append() method is used to add PDF files to the merger. Finally, the write() method is used to write the merged PDF to the output path.

The script clears the status cell in the first sheet of the workbook and then retrieves the source directory and output name from the respective cells. 
The PDF files are obtained using Path.glob() method, which returns all files with the .pdf extension in the specified directory.
The PDF files are then added to the PdfFileMerger object, and the merged PDF is written to the output path. The status cell is updated with the output path.

Overall, this script can be useful in merging multiple PDF files into a single PDF file, and it can be easily integrated into an Excel workbook.

To run this code:
The code assumes that there is an Excel file named "pdfmerger.xlsm" in the same directory as the Python script.
The Excel file should have a sheet with the following named ranges: "status", "source_dir", and "output_name".
